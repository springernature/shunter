# Shunter Migration Guide, 4.0 to 5.0

This guide outlines how to migrate from Shunter 4.x to Shunter 5.x. It outlines breaking changes which might cause issues when you upgrade.

## Logging

Updating [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/) from version 2 to 3 means that custom logging filters can no longer be used.

Instead [`filters` should be migrated to `formats`](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/blob/master/UPGRADE-3.0.md#migrating-filters-and-rewriters-to-formats-in-winston3) and supplied via a [custom logging transport](https://github.com/springernature/shunter/blob/master/docs/configuration-reference.md#log-configuration).
