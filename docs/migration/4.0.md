Shunter Migration Guide, 3.0 to 4.0
===================================

This guide outlines how to migrate from Shunter 3.x to Shunter 4.x. It outlines breaking changes which might cause issues when you upgrade.

Deploy timestamp moved
----------------------

The command line option `--deploy-timestamp-header` has now been removed, as we are not by default adding that deploy timestamp to proxied requests as a HTTP header rather than a query string parameter.

Syslog levels
-------------

If you're using the default logger, [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/), please note that there are [breaking changes](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200--2015-10-29) in this dependency.

EJS filters
-----------

The update from EJS version 0.x to 2.x carries with it the [potential for breaking changes](https://github.com/mde/ejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v201-2015-01-02); most significantly the removal of the filters feature.
